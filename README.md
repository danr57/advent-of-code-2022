## Mission brief
<article class="day-desc"><p>Santa's reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas. For that, their favorite snack is a special type of <em class="star">star</em> fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.</p>
<p>To supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of <em class="star">fifty stars</em> by December 25th. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.</p>
<p>Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants <em class="star">one star</em>. Good luck!</p>
